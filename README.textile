"_mite_":http://mite.yo.lk/en is a sleek time tracking tool for teams and freelancers.

<code>Redmine2mite</code> connects your Redmine account with your _mite_.account. Track your time easily on issues within Redmine and get them automatically send to _mite_.

Projects from Redmine can be bundled with _mite_.projects. Furthermore, you can specify which _mite_.services should be available in Redmine on a per-project basis.

h2. Requirements

* "Redmine":http://www.redmine.org/ >= 0.9
* "Ruby on Rails":rubyonrails.org >= 2.3
* a _mite_.account (you can easily signup for a "free 30 days trial account":https://signup.mite.yo.lk/signup/en )

*Please note:* For Redmine versions prior to 0.9 use the plugin "version 1.0":http://github.com/thomasklein/Redmine2mite/tree/v1.0. 

h2. Installation

# Add the repo as a submodule into the <code>/vendor/plugins/redmine2mite</code> directory of your Redmine installation
# Install the plugin schema by calling <code>rake db:migrate_plugins</code> via console
# Restart your Redmine web server (e.g. Mongrel, Thin, WEBrick) 
# Voil√°!

h2. Setup

Login to Redmine. You should now see on the top right corner the link "mite". Click on it. 

After providing your account data you can now interconnect your _mite_.projects and _mite_.services with a specific Redmine project. The selected values will appear on top of the list, if you create a new time entry in the respective project.

Precondition is having Redmine projects assigned to your user, of course :-)

h2. Usage

Once the connection to your _mite_.account was verified, sending your time entries to _mite_ is very easy. The two fields _mite_.project and _mite_.service have been added to the time logging mask. When creating or updating a time entry the plugin sends those values to your _mite_.account.
